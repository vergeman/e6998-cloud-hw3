==Dependencies, Compilation, Build==

This project used the Google App Engine plug-in with Eclipse Indigo.

Additionally, since JSP's are used, the project requires adding a *JDK* to the 
build path.



==General Code Outline==

*Servlets*
HW3 contains two servlets.  HW3Servlet is the main driver/landing page, and launches the operations 
defined in the HW specification.

ImageServlet's sole purpose is to query the database and deliver the rotated and
resized images using an /images?id=x URI. The browser invokes calls to this servlet from the html
generated by the JSP.

*RunTime*

Calls to the HW3Servlet first check the memcache for any data, otherwise it queries the database.  Cached values
are set to expire every 20 seconds, and are automatically re-populated by calls to the datastore.  Datastore 
values are checked for staleness and updated accordingly every minute.

Updates proceed by loading all WOEID's and asynchronously URL fetching them.  The results are parsed and 
stored in a Woeid object.  JPA is the persistence layer used to interact with lower-level datastore operations.

Once parsed, an additional round of URL fetches are done to download and store the image data for
the weather graphic.  The image is rotated 90 degrees and resized to 1.5 times the original value before
being stored in the associated object data store.

Queries are then run against the datastore to retrieve the 5 hottest and 5 coldest locations, and caching
those values if possible.  These values are then forwarded to the JSP and iterated through to generate
html tables.
 
An email is sent containing the hottest and coldest 5, in addition to all city and temperature pairs.  This
email is only sent on a full refresh, (ie when fetches occur) and not on responses retrieved "locally" (via 
cache or query)

*Organization*

org.akv2001.
	datastore:
			contains Persistence, Query, MemCache "manager" classes, in addition to an EntityManager class.
			
	fetch:
			contains fetching and parsing logic classes.
			
	image:
			resizing and image rotation functions
			
	mail:
			mail management classes
	
	servlet:
			main driver servlet (HW3servlet) and ImageServlet to deliver modified images
